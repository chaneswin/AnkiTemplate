## Usage
1. You can import file AnkiTemplate_transZH.apkg or from [AnkiWeb](https://#).

## Features
1. We can use touch/click/keyboard(Tab and Backquote) to translate between Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese.(Thanks: [kleinerpirat](https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/cloze-one-by-one-uncovering/12584))
2. Add a float button view for translate.(Thanks: [kleinerpirat](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1231171279))(Support English and Chinese automatically)

Some incorrect words show when translate.
